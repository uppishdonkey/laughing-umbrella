# Work Day Scheduler 

## Description 

This web application is a work day scheduler that lets you add important events to a daily planner. When the page is initially opened, the current date is displayed at the top of the screen. When you scroll down, you are presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past(gray) , present(red), or future(green).
When a time block is clicked, then you can enter an event. When the save button is clicked for the corresponding time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage. When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist.
